# Transparency and Accountability 

 #PageFromTheOriginal

This is a [[Page From The Original]].


All elements of the System commit to relationships of [[Transparency]] and [[Accountability]] with the Systems they are a part of of, the Systems that are a part of them, and  other Systems they relate to. 

Transparency is not absolute and should be balanced within the context of all other [[Rights and Responsibilities]] in a Spirit of Truth and Love.
