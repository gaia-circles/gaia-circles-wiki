The value of spirituality represents a connection to something greater than oneself, and can take many forms depending on an individual's beliefs and practices. It involves seeking meaning and purpose in life, discovering and deepening one's relationship with the [[Creator]], and involves practices such as meditation, prayer, and mindfulness.
