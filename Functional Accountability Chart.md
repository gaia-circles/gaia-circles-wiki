The Lionsberg System self-organizes on the basis [[Functional Accountability]] within clearly defined [[Domains of Responsibility and Authority]]. 

The delegation of Responsibility and Authority across sub-domains is made explicit and visible via a **Functional Accountability Chart**. 

Every Group and every Domain is encouraged to maintain an up-to-date Functional Accountability Chart.
